ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project builds and trains an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock prices. The model forecasts future stock prices based on historical stock market data.

ðŸ”§ Features
Downloads and processes stock market data

Prepares time series data for LSTM input

Builds an LSTM neural network using TensorFlow/Keras

Trains the model on historical data

Predicts stock prices for the next 30 days

Visualizes the predicted vs actual stock prices

ðŸ”® Results
The final output includes a graph comparing actual stock prices and the LSTM model's forecast for the next 30 days.![Screenshot 2025-07-06 175801](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7da42309-4606-48d6-89de-419bedae3533)
